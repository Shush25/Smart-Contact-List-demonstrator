# Smart-Contact-List-demonstrator
This a demonstrtion project for a smart contact list. This contact list uses an algorithm which automatically based on the time of the day puts the contact who is called
most during that time of the day on top and the rest are arranged in alphabetical order. This demonstrator will try to demonstrate this concept in order to provide a base for
future time based prediction algorithm models.
